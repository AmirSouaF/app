# Forum Like and Comment Feature

This repository contains the implementation of a forum-like application that includes features for liking and commenting on posts. The application allows users to interact with posts, express their opinions, and engage in discussions with other users.

## Features

### 1. Post Creation
Users can create posts by providing a title, content, and any relevant tags. Each post is associated with a unique identifier and includes information such as the author, creation date, and number of likes and comments.

### 2. Like a Post
Users can like a post to indicate their approval or agreement with the content. The number of likes on a post is visible to all users, allowing them to gauge its popularity.

### 3. Comment on a Post
Users can comment on posts to share their thoughts, provide feedback, or initiate discussions. Comments are displayed below the post and are organized chronologically, with the newest comments appearing at the top.

### 4. User Profiles
Each user has a profile page displaying their username, bio, and a list of their created posts. The profile page also shows the user's liked posts and the comments they have made.
